        Subqueries can be arbitrarily nested. This example traverses four tables
        to find the price of the most expensive product bought by each Buyer, but
        instead of using `JOIN`s it uses subqueries nested 4 layers deep. While this
        example is contrived, it demonstrates how nested ScalaSql `.select` calls
        translate directly into nested SQL subqueries.

        To turn the ScalaSql `Select[T]` into an `Expr[T]`, you can either use
        an aggregate method like `.sumBy(...): Expr[Int]` that generates a `SUM(...)`
        aggregate, or via the `.toExpr` method that leaves the subquery untouched.
        SQL requires that subqueries used as expressions must return a single row
        and single column, and if the query returns some other number of rows/columns
        most databases will throw an exception, though some like Sqlite will pick
        the first row/column arbitrarily.
